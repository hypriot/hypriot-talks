# Introduction

...it's NOT about me...

**Dieter Reuter**

  - Consultant [@bee42solutions](https://twitter.com/bee42solutions) 🐝

  - Hacker & Pirate by night
  
  - Working with Docker since >3 years

  - [Docker Captain](https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains) 🐳, 66 world wide
    
**--> I'm pushing Docker to ARM & IoT since >2.5 years**


---

# Introduction

...it's all about team work

**Hypriot Team [@HypriotTweets](https://twitter.com/HypriotTweets) https://blog.hypriot.com**

  - five individuals: Andreas, Dieter, Govinda, Mathias, Stefan

  - broad range of skill sets: Devs, DevOps, Trainers, Consulants

  - Open Source project to run Docker on ARM & IoT devices

**--> We've built HypriotOS, a Docker-enabled OS for Raspberry Pi**


---

# Introduction

...it's all about team work

**bee42 solutions gmbh 🐝 https://bee42.com**

   - DevOps company

   - Digital Transformation

   - System Architects & Consultants 

   - Trainings for DevOps, Containers & Docker

**--> We're scaling Docker containers - in a different way!**


---

# IoT Challenges

We'll get a huge number of devices...

- Development

- Delivery / Deployment

- Updates (new features, bug fixes)

- Security

- Low bandwidth


---

# Goals

Containers and the Internet of Things

- evangelizing to use Docker container on ARM boards

- convincing Docker containers for IoT applications

- enabling the Docker ecosystem on low-powered devices

*Gartner says 6.4 billion connected "Things" will be in use in 2016, up 30 percent from 2015*

*In turn, that number is expected to further explode by 2020, where the IoT market will include 20.8 billion things*

**--> pushing the Docker technology into the IoT world**


---

# Docker Advantages

- Containers are isolated

- Containers are portable 

- Containers can be really small

- it's easy to "install" software as a container

- an update is just to start a new container

**--> Docker helps to deliver Apps to IoT devices**


---

# Docker Development Stack

- Developers: Docker4Mac, Docker4Windows, Docker on Linux

- Testing: locally, on-premises (Jenkins, GitLab), Travis-CI, Circle-CI, CodeShip

- Production: backend services for Cloud & Private Cloud

- Deploy apps as containers on IoT devices (Linux on Intel, ARMv7, AARCH64, ...)


---

# Requirements for Docker on ARM

- Hardware min: 1x Core, ARMv6, 256MB memory

- Linux Kernel w/ Docker related kernel modules

- Operating System: Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, Buildroot/Yocto, ...

- Docker tools: Engine, Compose, Machine

**--> Docker is already building binaries for ARMv6/7 and AARCH64**


---
# Proof of Concept

Building a complete OS to use Docker on ARM / IoT devices...

.center[.image-30[![sketch](docker_pirate_raspberry_plus_docker-tools.png)]]

**--> complete Docker toolset on ARM**


---

# PoC - Easy Building Blocks

  - small and simple pieces

  - easy to understand
  
  - easy to develop
  
  - easy to maintain
  
**--> combine it like LEGO bricks**


---

# PoC - Full Transparency

  - develop locally (Vagrant + Docker) 

  - automated build server (Travis + Docker)

  - automated testing (ServerSpec)

  - automated releasing (GitHub releases)

**--> every single detail is visible**


---

# PoC - Parts and Ideas

HypriotOS

  - a Debian-based root filesystem (32 and 64-bit)

  - a board specific layer
    - Linux kernel
    - firmware
    - bootloader

  - a common layer
    - Hypriot specific settings and tools
    - Docker Engine
    - Docker Compose, Docker Machine

**--> creating ready-to-run SD card images**


---

# PoC - Open Source Everything

All these parts are already open sourced at GitHub https://github.com/hypriot

  - root filesystem: https://github.com/hypriot/os-rootfs

  - raw image: https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-raw

  - Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi

Come and try it out

  - hack on it

  - improve it

**--> it's all Open Source**


---

# Summary

Container are ready for IoT

- easier development w/ Docker (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- faster time-to-market

- security built-in w/ container isolation

- easier updates: new features/value, security fixes

**--> Docker already supports ARM 32bit / 64bit**
