# Introduction

it's all about team work

- Me, Dieter Reuter

  - Consultant at daytime
  - Hacker & Pirate by night

- Hypriot Team

  - five individuals: Andreas, Dieter, Govinda, Mathias, Stefan
   - [x] devs
   - [x] devops
   - [x] architects
   - [x] consultants 

--> We're scaling Docker containers - in a different way!

---

# Goals

Containers and the Internet of Things

- evangelizing to use Docker container on ARM boards

- convincing Docker containers for IoT applications

- enabling the Docker ecosystem on low-powered devices

*Gartner says 6.4 billion connected "Things" will be in use in 2016, up 30 percent from 2015*

*In turn, that number is expected to further explode by 2020, where the IoT market will include 20.8 billion things*

--> pushing the Docker technology into the IoT world

---

# Ways - 1. Iteration

run a proof-of-concept

  - select the Raspberry Pi as a popular device

  - tried to run Docker on a RPi model B
    - found only outdated tutorials 
    - using Alpine Linux was "special"
    - upgrading Raspbian takes 5 to 6 hours

  - let's improve this situation!
    - need to compile Docker on ARMv6
    - need to create a special Linux kernel
    - need to package all into a new SD card image

--> in the end, we built HypriotOS (based on Raspbian/Debian)

---

# Ways - 2. Iteration - Updates

porting the complete Docker ecosystem to ARM

  - Docker Compose

  - Docker Swarm

  - Docker Machine

created all Docker releases for ARM just-in-time

  - from Docker 1.4 until 1.10 (sometimes minutes after release!)

shipping every new Linux kernel version

  - from 3.18 until 4.1.12

switching to Raspbian Jessie

included support for the Raspberry 7" Touch Display

--> complete Docker toolset on ARM

---

# Ways - 3. Iteration - Cluster Lab

create a learning platform for clusters

  - cheap, using 3 to 5 Raspberry Pi's and a network switch

  - easy to setup a cluster with HypriotOS and Docker

    - Google's Kubernetes team members did it!

  - ready for classes in univercity

  - ready for talks and live demos

  - ready for professional trainings too

--> Hypriot Cluster Lab is just easy-to-use

---

# Ways - 4. Iteration (under construction!)

create a container OS for ARM devices

  - using a mainline Linux distro (Debian Jessie)

  - building blocks for ready-to-use SD images

  - support all important ARM devices

    - Raspberry Pi

    - ODROID C1+, XU4

    - Banana Pi

    - BeagleBoneBlack

    - Pine A64+

    - ODROID C2

--> device list will be continued...

---

# Concepts - Easy Building Blocks

  - small and simple pieces

  - easy to understand
  
  - easy to develop
  
  - easy to maintain
  
--> combine it like LEGO bricks

---

# Concepts - Full Transparency

  - develop locally (Vagrant + Docker) 

  - automated build server (Travis + Docker)

  - automated testing (ServerSpec)

  - automated releasing (GitHub releases)

--> every single detail is visible

---

# Concepts - Parts and Ideas

the *new* HypriotOS

  - a Debian-based root filesystem (32 and 64-bit)

  - a board specific layer
    - Linux kernel
    - firmware
    - bootloader

  - a common layer
    - Hypriot specific settings and tools
    - Docker Engine
    - Compose, Swarm, Machine

  - an optional application layer
    - Hypriot Cluster Lab

--> creating ready-to-run SD card images

---

# Concepts - Open Source Everything

All these parts are already open sourced at GitHub https://github.com/hypriot

  - root filesystem: https://github.com/hypriot/os-rootfs

  - raw image: https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-raw

  - Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi

  - ODROID C1/C1+: https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-odroid-c1

  - Banana Pi: https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-bananapi

Come and try it out

  - hack on it

  - improve it

  - add new boards and features

--> we need your help !

---

# Demo

---

# Current Status of HypriotOS

active Docker ARM community

  - Gitter channel (> 280 users)

  - Twitter is growing fast (> 750 followers)

  - increasing download numbers (Cloudflare helps)

everybody is using Docker on ARM right now

  - HypriotOS is the easiest way around

  - download and boot takes just 5 minutes

--> break all limits with the new HypriotOS !
